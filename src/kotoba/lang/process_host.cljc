;; `sh` — a policy-gated, portable drop-in for clojure.java.shell/sh.
;;
;; Unlike `os-spawn` above (which requires a host-supplied absolute-path
;; :binaries map and never touches PATH), `sh` mirrors clojure.java.shell/sh's
;; own ergonomics: argv[0] is a bare command name resolved by the OS's normal
;; executable search (ProcessBuilder / child_process do this themselves, the
;; same mechanism clojure.java.shell/sh itself relies on) — NOT a second PATH
;; scan implemented by this library. `sh` does NOT require `clojure.java.shell`
;; itself (that would defeat the point of this migration); the JVM branch
;; talks to `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` directly, and the ClojureScript/nbb
;; branch talks to Node's `child_process.spawnSync` directly.
;;
;; Every call is validated by `process/validate-spawn` BEFORE the OS spawn
;; primitive is ever invoked. When validate-spawn rejects the argv, `sh`
;; returns immediately with a sentinel `:exit -1` result — ProcessBuilder /
;; spawnSync is never called, so a rejected command never actually runs.

(defn sh
  "Policy-gated, SYNCHRONOUS drop-in for `clojure.java.shell/sh`.

  `(sh cmd & args)` — args may end in an options map, exactly like real
  clojure.java.shell/sh. Blocks until the child process exits and returns
  `{:exit <int> :out <string> :err <string>}` — the same keys and the same
  blocking contract real callers depend on. This is never async: there is no
  promise/future/callback under this name, because that would silently break
  every caller that expects `sh` to have returned only once the process is
  done.

  Every argv is checked by `kotoba.lang.process/validate-spawn` BEFORE
  anything is spawned. If validate-spawn rejects the argv (bad shape, a path
  separator in argv[0], or — when an `:allowed` set is supplied — argv[0] not
  in it), `sh` returns immediately with `{:exit -1 :out \"\" :err \"sh
  rejected: <reason>\"}` and NEVER calls the OS spawn primitive
  (ProcessBuilder on the JVM, `child_process.spawnSync` on ClojureScript/nbb)
  for that argv. This is a real security boundary: a rejected command is not
  spawned-then-discarded, it is never launched.

  Supported opts:
    :in       string piped to the child's stdin, which is then closed so
              stdin-reading commands (e.g. `cat`) see EOF and exit
    :dir      working directory, as a string (portable across JVM/nbb)
    :allowed  optional set enforced by validate-spawn's basename allowlist;
              omit to skip it (validate-spawn's structural checks — argv
              shape, no path separators in argv[0] — still apply)
    :max-stdout-bytes / :timeout-ms
              override this library's default bounds (`process/max-stdout-bytes`
              65536 / `process/max-timeout-ms` 600000ms); values above those
              constants are themselves rejected by validate-spawn

  NOT implemented — documented, not silently approximated:
    :out      real clojure.java.shell/sh's :out selects the stdout encoding
              (or :bytes). This always returns a UTF-8 string.
    :env      real clojure.java.shell/sh's :env replaces the child's
              environment. Not implemented: the child inherits this
              process's environment unchanged. Per-call env override is a
              real gap, not silently ignored.
    non-string argv coercion — real clojure.java.shell/sh stringifies
              non-string args (e.g. numbers, keywords) via `stringify-arg`.
              Here every element of argv is passed through `str`, which is
              close but not byte-identical for every Clojure value (e.g.
              `:foo` becomes \"foo\" via clojure.java.shell but \":foo\" via
              plain `str` on the JVM — cljs printing differs again). Callers
              that need exact clojure.java.shell stringify semantics must
              stringify their own args before calling `sh`.
    unbounded execution — real clojure.java.shell/sh blocks with no timeout.
              `sh` always applies `:timeout-ms` (default
              `process/max-timeout-ms`, 600000ms) and destroys the child
              process if it is exceeded, consistent with the rest of this
              library's fail-safe bounds."
